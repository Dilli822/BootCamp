Classmethod example
To turn a method into a classmethod, add @classmethod before the method definition. As parameter the method always takes the class.

The example below defines a class method. The class method can then be used by the class itself. In this example the class method uses the class property name.

class Fruit:
    name = 'Fruitas'

    @classmethod
    def printName(cls):
        print('The name is:', cls.name)

Fruit.printName()
