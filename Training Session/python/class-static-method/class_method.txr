    # Class method
    # is a method that is bound to a class 
    #rather than its object, it i shared amon all objects


    # we build the class method on class using @decorator
    example
    >>> class Sample:
...  @classmethod
...  def func(cls, arg1, arg2):
... 
# for normal we put self but in class method we put cls as param

class Vehicle:
    catgeory = "car"

    @classmethod
    def printCategory(cls):
       print(f'Vehicle category= {cls.category}')

        
    
    Vehicle.printCategory()

    my_vehicle = Vehicle()


    # it is used to create factory methods
