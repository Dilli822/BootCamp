   # function in python
   # function is a sytem which accepts the input , process it and give the ouptut.
   # similar to IO system input and output.
   # but it run outside from big program and gives output which can be used for further programming.
   # logic codes gets break into functions 

   >>> def message():
...    print("hello world from python shell")
... 
>>> message()
hello world from python shell


>>> # this is just a simple example of creating the function.
>>> # Here we created the message function with def keyword.
>>> # and it was printed with no parameters ()


>>> # passing param to function and calling it 
# here is f is f-string which is format string
this is {txt}
>>> def message(txt):
...   print(f"this is {txt}")
... 
>>> message("python is widely used in data science")
this is python is widely used in data science

# mechanism of function
# define the function
 >>> def message():
...    print("hello world from python shell")
... 
# call the function
>>> message()


#>>> def message():
...    print("hello world")
... 
>>> message()
hello world


# if we put the call function into variable and print it then none comes too
# this is because we only define and call the function but we didnot return the function
>>> def message():
...   print(f"hello")
... 
>>> result = message()
hello
>>> print(result)
None


# sending param and taking return in function
>>> def add(a, b):
...   return a + b
... 
>>> add(2, 5)
7
>>> result = add (2,8)
>>> print(result)   # 10 is return to function
10
>>> add(5,6)
11
