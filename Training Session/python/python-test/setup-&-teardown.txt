The test runs teardown blocks registered during a test method's execution 
after that test method ends, before the tearDown instance method is called.

When a setUp() method is defined, the test runner will run that method 
prior to each test. Likewise, if a tearDown() method is defined,
the test runner will invoke that method after each test.
