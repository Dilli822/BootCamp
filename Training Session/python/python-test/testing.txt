  # Why Testing?
  --> find the bugs before users do
  ---> to ensure the quality of the product
  --> to verfiy the efficency and software does what it meant to do
  --> after we write code for apps and deliver to users 
  --> our code may become faulty and includes bugs 
  --> so we do Testing as it is one of the most important part in programming and software development.
  


  # Testing can be done in 
    -----Mannual Testing--------
      # this Mannual Testing is done mannually together
      # with a group of team find the bug, solution and fix it

    ------Automated Testing-------
    # this is automated type and we write script for testing 
    # if our code gets passed through test case
