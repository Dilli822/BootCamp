   # OOP -> Object oriented Programming
   --> programming paradigm that provides states and methods/ properties and behaviours bundled into individual Object


    # classes in python
     --> blueprint for the Object
     # creating the python classes
     --> we create python class with class keyword
     --> keyword class is followed by object name
     --> CapWords convention or CamelCase notation
     -->we can create several objects with class keyword
     and each objects has several attributes and methods 
     which is defined

     # creating class
     class Vehicle:
         passs
        # this creates a class named Vehicle.
     
     # creating object  initiating object
     obj = Vehicle()
     # here obj is an object of Vehicle


     # attributes
     --> it is a characteristics of classes 
     # attributes are two types instance and class attributes
     # creating class with object vehicles

... class Vehicle: # whereas this is class attributes

...  def __inti__(self, color, doors):   # these init are instance attributes
...      self.color = color
...      self.doors = doors

# just above the init method we can find the class attributes

# The method used to call the object or init is called initializer
--> i.e. __init__(): or class init method 
# it is automatically called when we initiate the class

# class attribute are unique to each class
class Vehicle:
  category = 'car'  # here category is also class attributes

 def __init__(self, color, doors):  
     self.color = color
     self.doors = doors
