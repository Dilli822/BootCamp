   # Encapsulation
   --> foundamental concepts in OOP
   --> explains ideas of wrapping data 
   --> methods that work within one unit

 # it provides kind of security like preventing
 # the accidental modification of data
 # by putting the restrictions on accessing variables
 # and methods directly


 # we can prevent the accidental change by object's methods

 # those variables which can only be changes by object's methods
 # are known as private methods
