  # set in python
  # collection of the unordered elements
  # represented by elements enclosed in the curly braces separated by comma.
  # they are unique adn can be created using set() built in function 
  # example {1,2,3}
  # {"python", "is", "awesome"}
  # {1,2,3,(1,2,3)}
  # set is mutable but its elements are immutable
  # sets can be assigned in randomness and when it is printed repeated values are not printed
