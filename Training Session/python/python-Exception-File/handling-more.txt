# Handling Exceptions
---> we use try and except keywords to catch and handle
 Exceptions
# we place possible error code in try block
# and in case if error occurs then we keep the code 
# in a except block to handle it
    
         ------------syntax of try except block------------
         try:
           perform operations:
           ........................
         except Exception1:
            if Exception1. than execute this bloack.



         ------------How try and except works?--------------
            1. First, the try clause is executed

            2. if no exception occurs, the except clause
               is skipped and execution of the try statement is finished.
            
            3. if an exception occurs during execution of the try clause
               the rest of the clause is skipped.

# Example of try and except clause

>>> try:
...  distance = int(input('Enter a required distance to prevent Covid-19: '))
... except ValueError:
...  print('Value Error! Entered number is not valid. ')
... 
Enter a required distance to prevent Covid-19: STRING
Value Error! Entered number is not valid.
# value error is printed after conditons is falsed as it requires int not string


# Use of else block/clause 
---> if we have more than one except clause with try statements
--->to specify handling for different exceptions 
---> if all the exceptions conditions are not met
--> in the absence of exceptions, the else statement is used to 
--> instruct a program to execute a certain block of code

           --------syntax of try except1 except2 else clause---------
           try: 
            perform operations:
            ..........................
           except Exception1:
             If Exception1, then execute this block.
             ...............................
           except Exception2:
             If Exception2, then execute this block.
             ................................
           except Exception3:
             If Exception3, then execute this block.
            ...................................
            else:
              if no exception then execute this block.

# example
>>> try: 
...  distance = input('Enter a distance in m: ')
... except TypeError as error:
...     print(error)
... else:
...    print('ELse clause executed!')
... 
Enter a distance in m: 
ELse clause executed!

# this shows if error araises then else block won't run
# if finds no error then else runs 

# try-finally clause
--> it will gets execute at last before the
-->try statement completes
---> it implements some sort of action to
-->clean up after executing our code

# we also read else with try and more than one exceptions
... # we also read try-finally block which will finally gets run 
... # even after exceptions block conditions results in True or False..
... # it get s executed in any case
>>> try:
...  name = input('Enter your name: ')
... except TypeError as error:
...     print(error)
... else:
...     print('else clause executed! ')
... finally:
...     print('Finally clause executed at last.')
... 
Enter your name: 
else clause executed! 
Finally clause executed at last.
