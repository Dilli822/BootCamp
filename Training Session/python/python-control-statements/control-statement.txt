   # used to alter the flow of code block 
   # it changes the flow of our code when being used


   # supported contol statements in Python are:
   1. Break statement 
   2. Continue statement
   3. Pass statement

   # Break statement
   # we can terminate the loop
   # it break the flow of code in loop and 
   # come out of the loop

   word = "PYTHON"
   >>> word
'PYTHON'
>>> for c in word:
...  if c.lower() in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]:
...          break
...  print(c)
... 
P
Y
T
H

# here break statement broke th loop
# by finding & taking out the required elements
# satisfying the conditions

# example in while loop
>>> counter = 0
>>> while True:
...  print(counter)
...  counter += 1
...  if counter == 5:
...      break
...  print("Inside while loop")
... 
0
Inside while loop

# here when it meet with 5 
# loop gets broke with break statement
