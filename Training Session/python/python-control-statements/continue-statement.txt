  # continue statement in python
  >>> c = 0
>>> while c<5:
...  c+=1
...  if c == 3:
...           continue
...  print(c)
... 
1
2
4
5

# here continue will tell the loop 
# that when the c is equal to 3
# skip the value and again continue or restart the loop
# so above while satisfied the conditions
# and if c == 3 then loop will again continue 
# leaving/skipping the c value out of the value

>>> word
'PYTHON'
>>> for c in word:
...  if c.lower() in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]:
...       continue
...  print(c)
... 
P
Y
T
H
N
# here o value is skipped and loop is continued to N


# more on control statement
# we can also add else statement on loops
# right after execution/exhaustion of iteration
 of loops
 # else statement only gets executed right after the
 # exhaustion of loops 

# example in for loop
>>> word = 'LOVE'
>>> for c in word:
...  print(c)
... else:
...  print('First loop finished, second else')
... 
L
O
V
E
First loop finished, second else

>>> # example in while loop
... counter = 0
>>> while counter  < 4:
...  print(counter)
...  counter += 1
... else:
...  print("while loop finishes first, then else statement")
... 
0
1
2
3
while loop finishes first, then else statement
>>>
