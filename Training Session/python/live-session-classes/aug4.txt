  # Testing in python
---why?
---> time saving---
---> handles bugs and errors -----
----> make sure every line code work

----------most basic, important and fundamental testing unittest for smaller
---------------block of codes or small logics-----------
  # Automated testing and Mannual testing

----Automated testing----------
-----deep error checking----
-----make sure every function is working------

# coverage testing
---how much our test will touch the code while testing------
# positive and negative testing depends upon the size of logics.
# load testing ------
   ---giving load and threshold value for testing -----
--------and manage our server according to load (like users is 100)----
