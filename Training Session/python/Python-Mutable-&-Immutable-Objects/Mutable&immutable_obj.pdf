 # Mutable Obj
 # data can be changed after its creation or declaration
 # list set dict are mutable obj
 # used when we need to change the size or content of an object


 # Immutable Obj
 # Data cannot be changed after its creation or declaration
 # int float bool string tuple are immutable
 # used when objects need to remain same or constant
 # it is expensive to change it
 # it is more faster /can be accessed more fastet than mutable ones

# Examples of mutable objects
# list is mutable objects so we can actually the change the content
   list1 = ['one', '1','1.25','yellow']
>>> print(list1)
['one', '1', '1.25', 'yellow']
>>> #now change the element of lists yellow to black 
>>> list1[3] = "black"
>>> print(list1)
['one', '1', '1.25', 'black']

# Example of immutable objects 
 
  >>> tuple1 = ('sunday','monday','tuesday')
>>> prints(tuple1)
