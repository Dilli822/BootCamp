  #loop
  # used for repetition of code and implentaion of programs
  # two types of loop
  1. for loop
  2. while loop

  #for loop in python
  #it is used for iterating over a sequence 
  # i.e. list, tuple, dict, set, string
  # syntax
   for var in sequence:
        body of loop
  # it breaks untill it satisfies the conditions
  # but we can use break keyword to stop the iteration
>>> vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
>>> for v in vowels:
...  print(v)
... 
a
e
i
o
u

# here we have vowels is sequence
# and for loop print the every sequence
# and follow the iteration
# untill it print all the a,e,i,o,u 
# it stop the loop and gives result

for loop
conditions
body of loop
iteration
finish
stop the loop
