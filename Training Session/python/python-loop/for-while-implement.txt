>>>  # we iterators from iterables
>>> # usign the iter method
>>> # now mkaing while loop
>>> #instead of for loop

>>> names = ["john", "jane"]  # these are iterables objects
>>> name_iter = iter(names)   # now converted into iterators

>>> for name in names:
...  print(name)

# we can simply use for loop here but 
# here while loop is shown

>>> while True:  # this supposed to be infinite loop
...  try:        # Try a block of code, and decide what to to if it raises an error: 
...      name = next(name_iter)  # next function in iterator objects
...      print(name)
...  except StopIteration:   # loop at third time stop
...      break    # break our loop and print result

# this is mechanism of while loop 
# this same mechanism is used in for loop
# so we also say that for loop is while loop implementaion
#try keywords is used in try..except bloacks
# define a bloack os code test it it contains any errors
# try block handles the exceptions.
# at third time stopinteration expections occurs
