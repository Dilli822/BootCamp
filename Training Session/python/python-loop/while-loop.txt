 # while loop
 # unlinke for loop in python 
 # while loop doesnot follow the iteration
 # it check the statements
 # either it is true or false
 # runs untill the statement is

  # start loop
 # like one statement is true:
 # execute
  # start loop
 # 2nd statement is true:
 # execute
 # start loop
 #3rd statement is false:
 #stop the loop
>>> counter = 0
>>> while counter < 5:
...  counter += 1
...  print(counter)
... 
1
2
3
4
# here while loop check the counter conditions
# at first it check as if counter is less than 0 
# then it is true and do the addition +1 
# print result
# then it again check with conditions
# counter > 5 is true and again it do plus +1 
# until it becomes 4 it satisfies conditions
# stop the iteration and loop exist


# infinite loop
# it never stops and continue to do looping

while True:
  print("I am while infinite loop in python")
