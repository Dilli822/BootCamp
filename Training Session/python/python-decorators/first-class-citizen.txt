 # python first class citizen as python function
 # the fuction of python is also called first class citizen
 # due to these points

 a) we can store the function in a variable name and we can execute or 
 # call the function with varible name from anywhere in the program

 b) we can also send python function to another function by passing
 # parameter to anothe function as an argument

 c) function can also itself return the function


 # COncept of closure
 # and criteria to become a closure
 # there must be nested function
   for example there must be another function inside the parent function
 
 # The parameter used in the MAIN parent function must be used on the nested function
   i.e. The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function
 
 # main function must return the nested function/child function
 
 # for example  

  def greet(msg):  # this is a parent main function named greet with param(msg)

    
  1.   def print_message():   # this is nested function
             
   2.  print(msg)    # same param as main function

   3.  return print_message   # returns the nested function 
                             # this means our main function
                              greet function is returning
                       # the nested function i.e. print_message 

     # with these all points it satisified the criteria of 
     enclosing function


     # now we call our main function
     # storing it in message variable
     
     message = greet("hello world")
     message()
     # output is hello world
