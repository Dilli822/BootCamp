   # decorator?
   # decorators are the function in where
   # we made main function and 
   # pass the same function to 
   # another function  as a  parameter
   # and those passed function 
   # are called decorator.

   main function
        |
    passed the function
         |
    these function are decorator

   #Decorators are the functions which take our function
   as an argument and returns another function adding
   some extra functionality to our actual function
    
    >>> # making a simple function
... def ordinary():
...  print("this is ordinary function!")
... 
>>> ordinary()
this is ordinary function!
>>> # her simply ordinary function is called
... # with no param and arguments
... 
>>> # now we make decorator with param func itself
... def decorate_me(func):
...  def inner_func():
...      print("this is decorated and inner nested function")...      func()
...      func()
      return inner_func
... 
>>> decorated = decorate_me(ordinary)

>>> # here main function ordinary param is taken on decorator funtion 
... decorated()

this is decorated and inner nested function

this is ordinary function!

# now we make variable similar to func name
# here ordinary is not function but a variable
# but passed param ordinary is reference function
>>> ordinary = decorate_me(ordinary)
>>> ordinary()
this is decorated and inner nested function
this is ordinary function!


# from above expressions 
# it seems that def ordinary is being called
# but actually i.e. not a case
# return inner_func is actually called in reference ordinary


# use of @ 


def ordinary():
     print("ordinary!")
  
  ordinary = decorate_me(ordinary)
 ordinary()

 is same as below expression...

  # this line is not needed      
  ordinary = decorate_me(ordinary)
  # if we want to use @ decorate_me

   @decorate_me 
   def ordinary():
     print("ordinary!")

  ordinary()
