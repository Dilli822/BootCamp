  Z# lamba functions
  # this is pythonic way created to apply for small logic
  # this is not used in large logics
  # this is only used inline logics
  # nameless it has no  functions

>>> add = lambda a, b: a+b  
#since lambda has no function name and it is stored on variable
>>> r = add(2, 5)   #here 2 and 5 are positional arguments
>>> print(r)
7

>>> mul = lambda a,b: a*b
>>> r = mul(2,8)
>>> print(r)
16

# for making shorter functions by addgining into any variable
