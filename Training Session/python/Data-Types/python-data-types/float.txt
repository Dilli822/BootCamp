  #there is also scientific notation on float like we use e or E maybe +ve or -ve
  #Eg: 6.1e2 = 6.1 x 10^2 = 610.0
  >>> 6.1e2
  610.0
  >>> 5.12e12 = 2.12 x 10^12 
  5120000000000.0
  #using this data types takes eight bytes of memoty (64 its or double precision)

 #the max limit value of a floating type is 1.8 x 10^308
    >>> 1.8e308
    inf
    >>> 1.7e307
    1.7e+307
    >>> 1.0e307
    1e+307
    >>> 1e300
    1e+300
     >>>
