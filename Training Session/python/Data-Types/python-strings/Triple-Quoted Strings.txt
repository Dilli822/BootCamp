   # Triple quotes (''' or """)
   # escape sequences works but single & double quotes can work without using the escape sequences and more convenient way to create string with double & single quotes
   # it can also be used as doc string(explantary comments to python code)
   # Note : A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters used to specify the boundary between separate, independent regions in plain text or other data streams. An example of a delimiter is the comma character, which acts as a field delimiter in a sequence of comma-separated values.
   # so triple quotes can be used as string delimeters in python.

   # single line string
    >> print('''string with single quote (') and string with double quote (")''')string with single quote (') and string with double quote (")


     # multi line strings
    >>> #string with no escaping for newline 
    >>> print("""python is 
    ... 
    ... growing
    ... 
    ... day by day""")
      python is 

     growing

     day by day
