  # Formatted string literal (f-string)
  # introduced in python 3.6
  # they are string literals that have "f" at the begining and curly braces
  # containing expressions that will be replaced 
  # first we make variables like 
  # name = "dilli"
  # then we put this variable after the f-strings literals
  >>> name = "diili"
  >>> print(f"hi! {name}")
  hi! diili
  # f-strings are evaluated at runtime
  # we put variables inside the curly braces {}

  # multiple f-strings literals
  >>> id = "822"
  >>> profession = "student"
  >>> age = 22
  >>> print(
   ...    f"Hi! I am {name}. "
   ...    f"My id is {id}. "
   ...    f"I am {profession} & {age} years old. "
   ... 
    ... )
   Hi! I am diili. My id is 822. I am student & 22 years old. 

   # we can use triple quotation on f strings by keeping only strings 
   # or not keeping variables

   #double quotation with single quotation
    >>> f"hi ! {'dilli'}"
   'hi ! dilli'
   >>> f'hi! I am {'dilli'}

   #single with double 
   >>> f'hi! I am {"dilli"}'
   'hi! I am dilli'

   # triple quotation
   >>> f"""john"""
   'john'
   >>> f'''hang'''
   'hang'
   
   # special cases on double & single braces
   >>> print(f"{{2+3}}")
   {2+3}
   >>> #but with triple braces it acts like we are adding the numbers
   >>> print(f"{{{6+6}}}")
   {12}
