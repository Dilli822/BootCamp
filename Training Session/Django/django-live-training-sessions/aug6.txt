# errors in .get method.
# .get method only takes unique query.

# returned empty list if there is no specific data in our databases.
# for mulitple data having similar names or ages or datas
# like for user hari and shyam have same age 
# filter will show both objects data in the list.
# where as get method will not show both but throw error.

>>> Person.objects.filter(id=3).update(age=25)
>>> updating the age for user if mistakenly entered false age.
>>> 1 true and 0 false.
# Filter returned the queryset.
