  # URL's Designing

  ----Ways to do better url Designing------
  # Here are some good practices of url's desigining

  --> We should always design the url in a such way
  --> url is consistent as much as possible
  eg:
   [/home/self-user/address]
 -->separate words with hyphen
 [/home/profile-address]

# Contd..........
--> we must avoid database PK in URLs 
---> Don't ['/user/1] [/user/5]
-->instead use slug which are SEO friendly hashids or UUID
-->[/users/dilli-hang/]
--> [/users/45ghj5gvb4]
-->[/users/6fgfg4714fgfg-7897fgfvd74-784fgfv4-4544fgfsdx?topic=?]

# Pagination Best practices
 --> suppose we need to see the users list of 1akh in pages and log details
 --> Do's
 [/users/?page=1]
 -->Don't 
 [/users/page-1/]
 # some offset limit pagenations can also be used [/users/?limit=708&offset=07]


# other common approach
--> suppose we are approaching the user named dilli hang then 
-->we can design url for specific user
--> /profile/dilli-hang/followers/
--> /accounts/change-password/

# Sample URLconf

from djano.url import path
from . import views

#setting dynamic url patterns of int
urlpatterns = [
    path('articles/2003/'. views.special_case_2003),
    path('articles/<int: year>/>/', views.month_archive),
    path('articles/<int: year>/<int: month>/', views.month_archive),
    path('articles/<int: year>/<int: month>/<slug: slug>/', views.article_detail),
]


# at first line of url we created statically url
# it may be good or applicable for only specific conditions
# but it is not applicable and logical at all conditions

# so we made dynamic url from line 2 url path
# then we create logic in view as per requirement

# here we created dynamic url with pathfinder
like path ...articles...int year... which only accepts integer
    url //https://127.0.0.1/articles/2021/08/01
# if user enter string instead of int then error 404 is suppose to occur
