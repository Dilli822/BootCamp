# tags in template
# if tag is same as in normal python but we are using it inside the tag only.
# {% if %} tag evaluates a variable just like if/else in python


{% if athelete_list %}
     Number of athletes: {{athlete_list|length}}
{%elif athlete_in_locker_room_list%}
     Atheletes should be out of the locker room soon!
{%else%}
     No athletes.
{% endif %}

# we can use if else in templates using more complex logics.

# For tag in template
# same as python all the process is same but unlike in if tag we have ending tag {% endfor %}
<ul>
   {% for athlete in athlete_list %}
      <li>{{athlete.name }}</li>
   {% empty %}
       <li>Sorry, no athletes in this list.</li>
   {% endfor %}
</ul>
# in this loop if list is empty then there will be no iteration and  
# {% empty %} is printed out which is a feature given by django.
