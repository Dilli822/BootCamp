# How do I grab context in templates?
 ---> we used the context to send data to template.Now how to pick the data in content

---Use variables
        -outputs value from context
        -{{   }}

eg: 
My first name is {{first_name}}.My last name is {{sur_name}}

//with a context of {'first_name': 'Dilli', 'sur_name': 'Rai'},
//this template renders to:

My first name is Dilli. My surname is Rai.
-----we can change now first name and lastname----------

---USE TAGS
--provide arbitary logic in rendering process
---- surrounded by {% %}
eg:
  {% csrf_token %}
# some tage may require ending tags
# {%if user.is_authenticated %}Hello,{user.username}}.{%endif%}

# during form submission tokens of hidden values from attackers.
 

-->USE FILTERS
--->transforms the values of variables and tag arguments
--same as using variables but we filter the variables .

eg:
{{name|title}}
# with a context of {name: 'dilli hang'}, this template renders to:
       Dilli Hang
# what we got is Captialized letter of every first letter from lowercase.
# CHeck more filters in documentation.

# comments 
# {# #}
like
{# I am comment #}
This will be ignored by our content langauge.
