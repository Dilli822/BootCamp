  # Creating simple hello world view
  
  # now we create simple view 
  --> normally creating view also depends on url
  ---> we want to build simple url which accept request
  ---> and gives simple response

  --> lets do with a url ~/home
  ---> we now create a view which will return 'hello world '

  # view.py
  -->our first parameter is request
       request(method=get/post)
  ---> we import HttpResponse which is django made cache
  ---> we use it in our function  
  --> HttpResponse is also a class object
  ---> content is our attribute or property 
  ---> we access the content with obj
  def __init__(self, request):
        response = HttpResponse():
        response.content = "hello world this is first django http"
        return response

        # now we need to registere the view 
        # now we assume world url where django can get it
        # it is in django.urls 

        # there are many helps in the django 
        # path 

        # now we need to keep the urls in urlpatterns of url.py
        from django.urls import path

#this will instruct newly made url is registered and must be redirected
# and if clicked must land on home 
from django.urls import path
from world.views import home

urlpaterns = [ 
    path('world', home),
]
