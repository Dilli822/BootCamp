------------------Demo-Forms----------------------------

# First we create an app 
# register the app


# let's create urls.py in the djangoforms for the url
# then we create template folder and we can put files in  formsfolder.


# creating views 
# registering to url of formsfolder app.

---projectfolder
      ---- project folder with files
       ------ apps folder
       
 
 
 # we create urls.py inside the new app folder 
 # then we create a templates folder inside a app folder.
 # and again create template_html folder inside a templates folder for storing html files.
 # then we create index.html or any templates html files for front end part.
 
 -------we come to app/views.py and write small views logics---------
 ---- at app/urls.py we import the views func and pass url path i.e.path('home/', view_func_name),
 
 ---- then we register the url in the main project urls.py by importing include function and
 ---- we add path -- path('forms/', include('appsname.urls')),
 
 
 # let's create a simple form in html templates folder.
 # apps/templates/formspractice/forms.html

  -- How to send the data of form to the backend?-------
  
  # for that we go to the app/views.py and write small logics
  
 from django.shortcuts import render

from django.http import HttpResponse

def home_forms(request):
    if request.method == 'GET':
        print("====OK THIS IS GET METHOD.===")
        return render(request, 'formspractice/forms.html', {})
    else: # must be post method
        print(request.POST)
        return HttpResponse("OKOK")
        
        -----server will print we can check on server console for clear confirmation---
        ====OK THIS IS GET METHOD.===
[14/Aug/2021 16:21:10] "GET /forms/home/ HTTP/1.1" 200 458
====OK THIS IS GET METHOD.===
[14/Aug/2021 16:21:11] "GET /forms/home/ HTTP/1.1" 200 458
====OK THIS IS GET METHOD.===
[14/Aug/2021 16:21:15] "GET /forms/home/ HTTP/1.1" 200 458
====OK THIS IS GET METHOD.===
[14/Aug/2021 16:21:16] "GET /forms/home/ HTTP/1.1" 200 458
====OK THIS IS GET METHOD.===
[14/Aug/2021 16:21:16] "GET /forms/home/ HTTP/1.1" 200 458

-----this shows that by default our request method id GET 
--- for changing the request method of form what we do is change the method attribute of html form
-- ie. <form method="POST" action="forms/home">  </form> only for form posting method.
--- refresh the page and click on the submit button---

# we get error forbidden on page because while sending the form or while we are accepting the POST request from client we must include csrf token {% csrf_token %} in our forms.html and provide token to client-side.

# every post req must have csrf token so error has raised.
# we can add {% csrf_token %} anywhere inside th form tag of forms.html


-- now refresh the server and form page also check the view source page-
# this is what we get to see

    <form action="/forms/home/", method="post">

        <input type="hidden" name="csrfmiddlewaretoken"     value="ue66DwedCtQchxBCmtof8EfSBGVxhcbHgY9wACuL9HNEzkBb8mK8HUVERjY1BaGV">

        <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name"> <br>
        <input type="submit" name="submit">

    </form>
  
  # with single tag {% csrf_token %} django has generated input tag with hidden type, name and value(value is for cross side protection).
  
  --now we can post the data to server.
  
  ---OKOK will come after submitting the data.
  
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  
  # now lets write name or pass string value in the name field of form.
  # and submit to server.
  # checking the server terminal console we get.
  <QueryDict: {'csrfmiddlewaretoken': ['z1NxizhojMRsgIeg9Zuc0iUi8LDX05cXlLQXfFxWQ0OUyvePVSQ5zyA4ooGrk3Hb'], 'name': ['dilli'], 'submit': ['Submit Query']}>
[14/Aug/2021 16:37:30] "POST /forms/home/ HTTP/1.1" 200 4
# we are getting the information of client who had submitted the  form in this the client/user is dilli with submit query and unique csrf token value.

---also we can look the client's name directly on server console.
-- with function .get('name'))
 else: # must be post method
        print(request.POST.get('name'))
        return HttpResponse("OKOK")
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

--This is an example of simple form and user/client submitting the form with data and we are getting the data from user and extracting the information in a simple way..


--------------------------------------------------------
----Now let's make proper form---------

# it's good practice to make all the forms in the form.py 
# we make several fields in the forms.py of app folder.
# creating MyForm with field name
# now we can use this MyForm to render the data at the frontend and validate the data that comes to the backend.

# forms.py
from django import forms

clas MyForm(forms.Form):
     name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
     
-----------------------
# we create a new html file named django_form.html 
# and we create key value pair in context {'form': form}
# views.py

# we created a func 
# then obj called form and we pass the obj to the templates forms.html as context {'key': value }

from .forms import MyForm

def django_form(request):
    form = MyForm()
    return render(request, 'formspractice/django_form.html', {'form': form})
    
 
 # now we pass <form> {{ form }} </form>
 
 # ok let's make url for this.
 from .views import home_forms, django_form
 
 urlpatterns = [
    path('home/', home_forms),
    path('home/django-forms', django_form),
]

-----NOw hitting the url https://127.0.0.1:8000/forms/django-forms/
# we get name field 
# viewing the source page

  <form>
      <tr><th><label for="id_name">Name:</label></th><td><input type="text" name="name" maxlength="100" required id="id_name"></td></tr>
      
# this means django has created itself table field table row automatically.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# THis much only is done by django now we can or have to add the form tags and other input as we have done in previous forms.html

  <form action="/forms/home/", method="POST">

    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form }}

    <input type="submit" name="submit">
    
  </form>
  
 ----------------or-----------
  
   {% csrf_token %}
    <!-- {{ form }} -->
    <!-- {{ form.as_P }} means we are viewing form as paragraph-->
    {{ form.as_p }}
    </form>
 
   # view source page
   
    <form action="/forms/django-forms/" method="post">

    <input type="hidden" name="csrfmiddlewaretoken" value="6idvDmk9XMc9CJPJh3QKhOgexcZ7kSZFS2gVAsAHu09BUwPi3WcDQ4W0NP2BEQuT">
    <!-- <tr><th><label for="id_name">Name:</label></th><td><input type="text" name="name" maxlength="100" required id="id_name"></td></tr> -->

    <input type="submit" name="submit">

  </form>
  
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 ---now if we submit the form with name written and submit button
 # checking the server terminal console what we get is:
 
 [14/Aug/2021 17:11:48] "GET /forms/django-forms/ HTTP/1.1" 200 537
dilli
[14/Aug/2021 17:13:59] "POST /forms/home/ HTTP/1.1" 200 4

# noticed GET/ Is changeD into POST/

# but if we look into the django_form func from where template is rendered 
# we havenot mentioned any POST or get

def django_form(request):
    form = MyForm()
    return render(request, 'formspractice/django-form.html', {'form': form})

# THis shows the form has done post request in the backend.
