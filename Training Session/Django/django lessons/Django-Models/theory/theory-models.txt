--------------Models---------------
1. Model
       -->Mediator between website interface and database
       --> implements logic for application's data domain

        website inteface -----> Model <-------database

        information to server 
        ---information --->controller-----> Model(apply business logic)
        ------>stores it to the database
    
----------------Admin---------------
-----------Model Validation---------
-----------Query Set----------------
----------Field LookUp--------------

----Django Admin------
# automatic admin interface,powerful parts of Django
# it provides CRUD for our models
# admin is enabled by default startproject
# By default, logging into the admin requires that the
# user has the is_superuser or is_staff attributes set to True .


# Registering models to Admin site
# as django gives us CRUD For our models.
# what we do is we go to any apps folder and find the admin.py
# we need to let know the django that make CRUD for our model.
----registering models to admin.py

# admin.py 
>>> from django.contrib import admin
>>> from .models import ContactNumber
>>> admin.site.register(ContactNumber)

# we pass model in admin.site.register function.
# at present we have ContactNumber named model.
# this is the configuration of registering models to admin.py

------------Creating a User-----------

# django by default comes with a user authenication system which handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions
# we need user to login in django-admin
# creating a superuser
 -----python manage.py createsuper----------

# these types of feature makes our work faster and helps in rapid application development.

# most powerful superuser
-------now we can login in Djano admin----------

# registered models is found in django administration.


-------Model Field Validation-------------
# application level validation
# in our model we need to validate the fields
# for that we can pass validator list in the fields
# and we can create and write,pass functions
# we can pass n number of functions in the fields



# Here name should start with Nepal to make condition  applied.
# If condition not meet we raise exceptionError for that we import the .core.exception and ValidateError from django
# now we catch the error if error is found from try catch block.

# eg:
from django.db import models
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

def validate_name(name):
    print('name', name)
    if "Nepal" not in name:
        raise ValidateError("name should start with Nepal.")

class ContactNumber(models.Model):
      name = models.Charfield(max_length=250, validators=[validate_name])
      lat = models.Charfield(max_length=250)
      long = models.Charfield(max_length=250)

# sometimes we return the username doesnot match which is an application of model field validation.


--------------full clean method---------------
# Validators never runs automatically as it is application level validators
# to make it run we apply full clean method to run the field validation and we can write validators and it also run other filed validations.

# example
# here we made an object num and put many data inside it 
# with obj.save() we can save it in database.
-----------but we have to validate the obj data first---------
# but with try catch block we can catch error and with full clean method 
# we validate the field
# if we find error we can put logics and debug
# then if not found error we save it.

num = ContactNumber()
num.name = 'Ram'
num.lat = '27.00'
num.long = '85.52'

try:
   num.full_clean)_
except ValidateError as e:
   # some erros
   pass
else:
    num.save()



------------Built in Validators---------------------
# In the above we built small validators but there are numerous built-in-validators
--Regex,Email,URL,MinValue,MaxValue


# if we need minimum value requirement for that we can apply like this built-in validators or use own functions for that.
# value has min value is 10 and user cannot put less than 10 value interger
# if user doesnot put 10 value integer then exception error will raise
# and we will know that there is Validationerrors and user
# may be notified about the requirements of min10 value as validationerror

# Eg:
from django.db import models
from django.core.validators import MinValidator

class MyModel(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=250)
      value = models.IntegerField(validators=[MinValueValidator(10)])



--------------Validation model as a whole----------------------
---Model.clean()
# if we need to compare, or validate the whole model
# for particular field we do validations in list.
# but for whole model we have .clean() method built by django
# we check conditions in clean method.
# in this method we check two fields at a time using clean as whole field

from django.db import models
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    value = models.IntegerField()
    threshold = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
   
    def clean(self):
        # check, if value is greater than 100 then threshold must be assigned
        if self.value > 100
           if not self.threshold
               raise ValidationError("Threshold is required when value is greater than 100")

--------------------------------------------------------------

-----How Django knows to UPDATE Or INSERT?---------------------
# Django uses same save() method for creating or updating objects.
# PK = primary key of an object
# if pk value is not set or None or empty string then updated is executed.
# if obj's Pk value is inserted mannually and that doesnot exists in DB, then INSERT is executed.

# example:
obj1 = MyModel(name="Ram", value=50)
obj1.id()
obj1.save() # a new object is saved, let say PK=1

obj1.name = "Ram Bahadur"
obj1.save() # since obj1 Pk=1, so its a UPDATE

# change the obj1 Pk i.e. ID to None
obj1.id = None
obj1.save() # since obj1 pk is None so its a INSERT
            # so a new object is created
