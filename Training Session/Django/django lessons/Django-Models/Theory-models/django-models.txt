 -------------------------Django Models------------------

# It is a single, definitive source of information about our data.
# It contains the essential fields and behaviours of the data we are storing.
# we have to create class based models in django.

# every models class should be subclass of django.db.models.Model
# and our each attributes of the model represents a database field
# django gives us an automatically generated database access API that lets us create, retrieve , update and delete objects.

# we use SQLite database in the django for connecting our models and storing datas.
# django allows /gives us power(ORM) to do such mentioned above things which we called ORM.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This example model defines a Person, which has a first_name and last_name
# Each field is specified as class attributes, and each attributes maps to a database column.

# we must include models.Model as param in class in models.py
# which inherit models from django.db

# Here first_name and last_name are special attributes
# bcoz we are assigning models from CharField and creating obj charfield through models.

-----we also use models.integer() for int.----------

# Eg:
# models.py
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
      first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
      last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)


-----------options we can use in field-------------
---------read the documentation--------------------

-------Generation of SQL from Person models--------
-------which would create database table like this-----
# we made Person models which would generate sql database like this

>>> CREATE TABLE myapp_person(
        "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        "first_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
        "last_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
    );
---here by default django use (appname_model)----
--for this case myapp_person (myapp is our app name and Person is our model name)

# NOT NULL means not accepting the empty value
# if we want null value to be accepted we can make NULL = True
# "first_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL means our first_name attributes accepts variable characters of 30 length.


-------Special code statement is generated in our table------

>> "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
# we have not passed any such attributes like id 
# so where did come from?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
# By default django generates automatically id for each and every models
# which will  be a primary key.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Notes:
1. The id field is added automatically by default, but can be customized or this behaviour can be overridden.
----this means we can change id to id_id or use any another field as primary key

2. The table name is automatically derived from model metadata which can be overridden.
-----for overrriding it we can modify the meta class in the model.


---------------------DataBases------------------------------

# Where are databases?
--> we created models and SQL but where is our database.

# Django officially supports
 1. PostgreSQL
         -version 9.5 and higher and psycopg2 2.5.4 or higher
 2. MariaDB
          -added in django 3.0, supports 10.1
 3. MySQL
      - django supports MySQL 5.6 and higher and requires mysqlclient 1.3.13
 4. Oracle
       - Supports Oracle Database Server versions 12.2 and higher 
        - version 6.0 or higher of the cd oracle python driver is required
 5. SQlite
       - Django Supports SQLite 3.8.3 and later.
       - for small application development as it is file system db.


------By default SQLite comes with django-------------

# Settings,py
# Here django is using default sqlite3 as db.backends ENGINE 
# name is where our database gets stored or its path.

DATABASES = {
     'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django'db.backends.sqlite3',
           'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
         }
       }
 # in case we want to use PostgreSQL we have to modfiy settings according to PostgreSQL database requirement.

---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------Migrations--------------------------

# Migrations are Django's way of propagating changes we make to our models into our database schema

# Available Commands
--- migrate, which is responsible for applying and unapplying migrations

--- makemigrations which is responsible for creating new migrations base on the changes we have made to our models.

--- sqlmigrate which displays the SQL statement for a migration.

--- showmigrations which lists a project's migrations and their status.
