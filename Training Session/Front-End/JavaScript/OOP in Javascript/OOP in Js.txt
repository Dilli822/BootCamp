-------Javascript Encapsulation---------------
- Mechanism of restricting direct access to some of the 
object's component and bundling data with methods
that operate on the data.

- use var keyword to make data members private
- use setter methods to set the data and 
getter methods to get the data


---Why Encapsulation:
- security controlled access
- Hide implementation and expose behavior

---- we can allow to give direct access to the data 
or not with js 


-- Javascript Abstraction
--- js AbstractionClass 
-- An Abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation
details and showing only the functionality to the users.
In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details 
and shows only the required one.

-For eg: we only gives output or result to the
users after taking the input.
we donot show all the processs and damn codes.

--Javascript Inheritance
- process where one class acquires properties from another class
  parent -> child


----Javascript Polymorphism--
-- The Polymorphism is a core concept of an object-Oriented
paradigm that provides a way to perform a single
action in different forms.It provides an ability
to call the same method on different Javascript objects.
As Javascript is not a type-safe language, we can pass
any type of data members with the methods.

---we can overrride the parent properties from child class.
--- we can override the methods of parent from child class.
