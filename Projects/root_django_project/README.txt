- Welcome to main root working Django Project Folder
-


Note: We must have django custom user model and register it in the settings.py
-- so there will be no huge works or problems in the middle of project 
--- while creating custom user model and doing migrations 
--- AUTH_USER_MODEL =  'user.User'------
----- if we have correctlty set up our user model then---
--- there will be no auth_user table in our db ------
---- there will be user_user table and others table so on------
